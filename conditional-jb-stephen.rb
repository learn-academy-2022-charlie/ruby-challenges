# pseudo code
# prompt user to either rock, paper or scissors
# get info and push to a variable
# give user 2 a prompt to either rock, paper or scissors
# get info and push to a different variable
# we assign values between rock paper or scissors
# we can assign rock >scissors
# we can assign scissors > paper
# we can assign paper > rock
# rock = 20
# scissors = 10
# paper = 5
#line 19 - 20 will not work
# we can assign lines 16 - 18 into arrays
