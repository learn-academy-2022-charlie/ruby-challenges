# Challenge: Tasklist with TDD
# For each story:
# Copy the story into your RSpec file as a comment
# Write the test(s) that class/method tests must pass
# Then run the test(s) and see that they fail
# Then implement the class/method, with comments, so that it passes the tests one at a time
# User Stories

class Task
attr_accessor :title, :description
    def initialize description='in progress'
        @description = description
        
    end
    def task_done
        @description = 'done'
